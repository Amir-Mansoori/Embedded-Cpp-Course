# Memory types in embedded systems
We can divide memory types in embedded systems into **Volatile** and **Non-volatile** memories:

- Volatile: loses data when power is off
- Non-volatile: keeps data when power is off

In terms of access type to the memory, there was an old _Sequential access_ that could read the memory contents only sequentially (ex:magnetic tapes). That is the meain reason of naming
